# Handoff Summary - PulsePath Development Session

## Session Overview
**Date**: December 2024  
**Duration**: Full development session  
**Phase Completed**: Phase 1 - Foundation Setup  

## Overall Goal
Transform a fresh Flutter project into a production-ready foundation for PulsePath, an HRV-based wellbeing tracking app with encrypted cloud sync and adaptive pacing for chronic illness recovery.

## Key Decisions & Approaches

### Architecture Decisions
- **Feature-based structure**: Organized code by domain (hrv, dashboard, settings, sync) rather than technical layers
- **Offline-first design**: Encrypted local database with sync queue for seamless offline operation
- **Security-first approach**: AES-256 encryption, zero-knowledge cloud sync, no plaintext biometric data storage
- **State management**: Riverpod 2.x for reactive state with get_it for dependency injection

### Technology Stack Choices
- **Database**: Drift + SQLCipher for encrypted relational storage (chosen over Hive for complex HRV queries)
- **Models**: Freezed for immutable data classes with JSON serialization
- **UI Framework**: Material 3 with adaptive theming for cross-platform consistency
- **Code Generation**: build_runner for automated model and database code generation

## Specific Code Changes Made

### Project Configuration
- Updated `pubspec.yaml` with 50+ dependencies including Riverpod, Drift, Firebase, health tracking
- Configured `analysis_options.yaml` with strict linting (complexity ‚â§15, prefer_single_quotes, etc.)
- Set Dart SDK constraint to ^3.4.0 to match project requirements

### Core Infrastructure
- Created `injection_container.dart` with get_it service locator pattern
- Implemented `app_providers.dart` with Riverpod providers for secure storage and app initialization
- Built `app_constants.dart` with all HRV metrics, performance targets, and configuration values
- Added `app_exceptions.dart` with typed exceptions for HRV, device I/O, and storage operations
- Created `app_utils.dart` with basic HRV calculation functions (RMSSD, SDNN, pNN50, etc.)

### Data Layer
- Designed `hrv_reading.dart` with complete Freezed models for HRV metrics, scores, and readings
- Implemented `app_database.dart` with three tables: HrvReadings, Settings, SyncQueue
- Configured SQLCipher encryption with proper PRAGMA settings for security
- Set up database migration strategy for future schema changes

### Application Layer
- Updated `main.dart` with Riverpod integration, Material 3 theming, and welcome screen
- Created initial UI showing PulsePath branding and feature preview
- Implemented basic widget test for app startup verification

### Version Control
- Initialized git repository with proper Flutter .gitignore
- Created GitHub repository: https://github.com/L-Hall/pulse_path
- Made comprehensive initial commit with detailed description

## Current State

### ‚úÖ Fully Completed
- All dependencies installed and resolved
- Code generation completed (*.g.dart, *.freezed.dart files)
- Database schema created and encrypted
- App compiles and runs successfully
- Tests pass (basic widget test)
- Quality gates satisfied (flutter analyze has only minor style warnings)
- GitHub repository created and code pushed

### üîß Technical Implementation Ready
- Folder structure established for all features
- Database models and repositories scaffolded
- Dependency injection container prepared for service registration
- Error handling and utility functions in place
- Constants and configuration centralized

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Technical Debt
- Database encryption key is currently hardcoded as "temporary_key_replace_with_secure_key"
- Firebase configuration not yet added (awaiting project setup)
- Some dependency versions were downgraded for compatibility (e.g., Riverpod 2.x instead of 3.x)

## Next Steps (Phase 2 Priority)

### Immediate Focus: HRV Metrics Engine
1. **Create HRV service class** in `/lib/features/hrv/domain/services/hrv_calculation_service.dart`
2. **Implement all 14 HRV metrics** specified in the PRD with proper mathematical formulas
3. **Add comprehensive unit tests** with reference vectors for validation
4. **Build score calculation logic** to convert HRV metrics to 0-100 Stress/Recovery/Energy scores

### Camera PPG Implementation
1. **Create camera service** in `/lib/features/hrv/data/services/camera_ppg_service.dart`
2. **Implement frame capture pipeline** with proper error handling and permission management
3. **Build signal processing** for heart rate detection from camera frames
4. **Create 3-minute capture UI** with progress indication and quality feedback

### Repository Pattern
1. **Implement HRV repository** in `/lib/features/hrv/data/repositories/hrv_repository_impl.dart`
2. **Add CRUD operations** for HRV readings with proper encryption
3. **Create data export functionality** (CSV/JSON as specified in PRD)

## Critical Success Metrics for Next Phase
- ‚â•95% PPG capture success rate on test devices
- All HRV calculations within ¬±10ms accuracy vs Polar H10 reference
- <400ms dashboard load time
- ‚â•80% unit test coverage
- Zero flutter analyze errors

## Repository Information
- **GitHub URL**: https://github.com/L-Hall/pulse_path
- **Branch**: main
- **Last Commit**: "Initial commit: PulsePath Flutter app foundation"
- **Key Files**: See CLAUDE.md for complete file structure and implementation details

The foundation is solid and ready for core feature development. All architectural decisions align with the PRD requirements for a production-grade health application.
