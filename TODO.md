# TODO.md - PulsePath Development Tasks

## 🚨 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW REMINDER 🚨
**After EVERY code change, ALWAYS:**
1. ✅ Run `flutter build web` or `flutter build apk --debug` to verify no configuration errors
2. ✅ Run `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos` to check for compilation issues  
3. ✅ Commit changes with `git add . && git commit -m "descriptive message"`
