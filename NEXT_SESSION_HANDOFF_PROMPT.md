## Current State Assessment Needed

Before starting new work, please:

1. **Read these key files** to understand the current architecture:
   - `/CLAUDE.md` - Complete project overview and development guidelines
   - `/TODO.md` - Updated task list showing Phase 2B completion and Phase 3 priorities
   - `/docs/prd.md` - Product requirements and feature specifications
   - `/lib/features/hrv/domain/services/hrv_calculation_service.dart` - Complete metrics engine
   - `/lib/features/hrv/presentation/providers/hrv_providers.dart` - HRV state management
   - `/lib/features/hrv/presentation/pages/hrv_capture_page.dart` - Working camera PPG capture UI
   - `/lib/features/hrv/data/datasources/camera_ppg_datasource.dart` - Camera data source
   - `/lib/features/hrv/domain/services/ppg_processing_service.dart` - PPG signal processing

2. **Verify the build state**:
   - Run `flutter pub get` to ensure dependencies are resolved
   - Run `flutter analyze` to check for any issues (should be clean)
   - Run `flutter test` to verify tests still pass

## Primary Objective for This Session

**Implement Dashboard UI & Data Persistence** - the next critical components for Alpha release.

### Specific Tasks (in priority order):

1. **Dashboard Home Screen**:
   - File: `/lib/features/dashboard/presentation/pages/dashboard_page.dart`
   - Create home screen with three score cards (Stress, Recovery, Energy)
   - Implement real-time score display from HRV readings
   - Add Material 3 design with proper theming
   - Create responsive layout for different screen sizes

2. **HRV Trend Visualization**:
   - File: `/lib/features/dashboard/presentation/widgets/hrv_trend_chart.dart`
   - Add trend chart using fl_chart with 60fps animations
   - Display historical HRV data over time (daily, weekly, monthly views)
   - Implement interactive chart with zoom and pan capabilities
   - Show score trends for Stress, Recovery, and Energy

3. **Database Repository Implementation**:
   - File: `/lib/features/hrv/data/repositories/hrv_repository.dart`
   - Complete database repository for HRV reading CRUD operations
   - Add search and filtering capabilities for historical data
   - Implement data pagination for large datasets
   - Create efficient queries for dashboard data loading

4. **Data Export & Management**:
   - File: `/lib/features/settings/presentation/pages/data_export_page.dart`
   - Implement data export functionality (CSV/JSON formats)
   - Add data import capabilities for backup restoration
   - Create data retention policies and cleanup utilities
   - Implement offline-first sync queue preparation

### Success Criteria for This Session:
- Functional dashboard displaying HRV scores and trends
- Database repository with full CRUD operations
- Data export/import capabilities working
- <400ms dashboard load time achieved
- Clear progress toward Alpha release completion

### Important Technical Notes:
- **Build on existing systems**: Use `HrvCalculationService`, `HrvScoringService`, and camera PPG capture
- **Performance**: Target <400ms dashboard load time and 60fps chart animations
- **Data flow**: HRV readings â†’ Database â†’ Dashboard display â†’ Export capabilities
- **Architecture**: Follow established repository pattern and dependency injection
- **Security**: Continue zero-plaintext approach for health data encryption
- **UI/UX**: Maintain Material 3 design consistency with existing capture page

## If You Encounter Issues:
- The HRV metrics engine and camera PPG capture are fully functional and tested
- All dependencies are properly configured and services are registered
- The database schema is already set up with HRV data models
- The database encryption key is currently hardcoded (marked as technical debt)
- Camera PPG capture is working and can generate HRV readings for testing

## Expected Outcome:
By the end of this session, we should have a complete Alpha-ready app that can:
- Display real-time HRV scores (Stress, Recovery, Energy) on dashboard
- Show historical trends and data visualization
- Store and retrieve HRV readings from encrypted database
- Export data for user backup and analysis
- Provide complete user journey from capture â†’ analysis â†’ visualization â†’ export

This will complete the core Alpha functionality and make PulsePath ready for initial user testing!

Ready to build PulsePath's beautiful dashboard and data management system! ðŸ“Šâœ¨
