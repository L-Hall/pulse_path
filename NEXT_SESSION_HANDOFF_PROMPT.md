3. **BLE Integration**: Add wearable device support (Polar, Garmin, Apple Watch)
4. **Metric Details**: Create drill-down screens showing all 14 HRV metrics in detail
5. **Cloud Sync**: Implement offline-first sync queue preparation

### **Medium Priority - Enhanced Features**
1. **Firebase Integration**: Cloud sync with end-to-end encryption
2. **Health Platforms**: HealthKit/Google Fit integration
3. **Adaptive Pacing**: Implement Adaptive Pacing Mode for chronic illness
4. **Notifications**: Push notifications and background HRV reminders  
5. **Advanced Visualization**: More chart types and customization options

### **Low Priority - Monetization**
1. **Subscriptions**: Implement StoreKit 2 + Play Billing v6 paywall
